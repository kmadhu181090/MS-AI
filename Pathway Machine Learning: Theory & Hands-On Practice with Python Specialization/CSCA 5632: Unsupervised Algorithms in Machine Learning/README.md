Project Description:
Online Retail dataset is taken from the kaggle wherein they have taken the dataset from UCI Irvine Machine learning repository.
This dataset contains transactional data which contains all the transactions between 01/12/2010 to 09/12/2011 for a UK based and 
registered non-store online retail.It has retail information about occasional gifts.Most of the customers involved are wholesalers.

Number of rows: 541909 Number of Columns: 8

File Size: 22.6 MB

Variables/Data types/Description:

1.InvoiceNo: Categorical - a 6-digit integral number uniquely assigned to each transaction. If this code starts with letter 'c', it indicates a cancellation.

2.StockCode: Categorical - a 5-digit integral number uniquely assigned to each distinct product.

3.Description: Categorical - Product Name

4.Quantity: Numeric - The quantities of each product (item) per transaction.

5.InvoiceDate: Numeric - Invoice Date and time.the day and time when each transaction was generated.

6.UnitPrice: Numeric - Unit price. Numeric, Product price per unit in sterling.

7.CustomerID: Float - Customer number. Nominal, a 5-digit integral number uniquely assigned to each customer.

8.Country: Object - the name of the country where each customer resides.

Main Goal of the project:

Understand Customer purchasing behaviour using RFM strategy (Recency/Frequency/Monetary)
Identify distinct customer groups using k-means clustering , HDBSCAN/DBSCAN and hierarchical clustering algorithms.
Detect Outliers (Customers with unusual purchasing patterns)
Providing actionable insights for the marketing teams.
