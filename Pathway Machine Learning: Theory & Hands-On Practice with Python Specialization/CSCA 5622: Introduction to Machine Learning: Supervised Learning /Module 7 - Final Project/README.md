Credit Card Clients Default:

Project Description

This project focuses on predicting customer default behavior using the Default of Credit Card Clients Dataset, originally sourced 
from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and hosted on Kaggle. The dataset contains financial and demographic information for credit 
card clients in Taiwan, spanning from April to September 2005. Key features include balance limits, bill amounts, payment history, and 
personal attributes such as age, education, and marital status.

Goal/Objective:

The objective is to build a supervised machine learning model to classify whether a customer is likely to default on their credit card payment. 
This is framed as a binary classification task, and multiple algorithms—including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and 
Support Vector Classifier—were trained and evaluated.

Data Size:

Number of records: 30000 Number of Features: 25 Data FileName: UCI_Credit_Card.csv (1 File - 2.86 MB)

Data Type of Features:

Categorical Features - Education,Sex and Marriage (Since it has values like 0,1,2 etc, its mentioned as numerical feature)
Numerical Features - PAY_AMT(1 to 6),BILL_AMT(1 to 6),PAY(0 to 6),LIMIT_BAL
